RespireAI: Building an automatic medical diagnostic application which takes in chest audio and chest X-ray images and accurately diagnoses respiratory diseases based on a ML model. 
We hace made you of VGG-16 Model with Adam Optimiser for the audio and ResNet50 model for the Image model.
Then using multi-modality, we consider the probablity diagnostic scores of both the models, feed it into an ANN to get the final results.
